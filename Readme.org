#+TITLE: Mandoku Starter Kit

* Overview

  This repository contains the minimal setup to get started with
  =mandoku= (see http://www.mandoku.org). 

  To use the repository, clone it into your .emacs.d directory:
#+BEGIN_SRC 
cd ~/.emacs.d
git clone git@github.com:cwittern/md-init.git
#+END_SRC
  Now add the following lines to the file =~/.emacs.d/init.el=
#+BEGIN_SRC 
(setq mandoku-base-dir (expand-file-name "~/krp"))
(load "md-init/md-init.el")
#+END_SRC
  You might want to restart emacs or evaluate the lines manually.
  
  Upon the first start, =mandoku= and the metadata packages
  =mandoku-meta-kr= and =mandoku-meta-zb= will be installed.
